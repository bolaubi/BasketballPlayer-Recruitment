## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to develop a binary classification machine learning model designed to identify potential basketball players for recruitment. 

The underlying assumptions for this project are as follows:

- H0: Do not hire
- H1: Hire

In this context, it is **acceptable to have a higher number of False Negatives (accepting False H0)** than False Positives (rejecting True H0). In simpler terms, it is preferable for the model to classify more candidates as "Do not Hire" (H0) than as "Hire" (H1). This approach is chosen because **hiring underperforming individuals can lead to more substantial costs**. Therefore, in this case, a higher False Negative Rate is considered more favorable than a higher False Positive Rate. Consequently, the chosen metric for the classification process is "**Precision.**"

## Some Findings

The final model employed was a combination of models (green-highlighted) using a voting classifier, which performed well with only 13 misclassifications out of a total of 2229 players, all of which were classified as false negatives. As a result, the final model achieved a 0% False Positive Rate and a 0.143% False Negative Rate.

19. ts_pct            : True Shooting Percentage *(A shooting percentage that factors in the value of three-point field goals and free throws in addition to conventional two-point field goals)*
20. ast_pct           : Assist Percentage *(The percentage of teammate field goals a player assisted on while they were on the floor)*
21. season            : Season
