## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to develop a binary classification machine learning model designed to identify potential basketball players for recruitment. 

The underlying assumptions for this project are as follows:

- H0: Do not hire
- H1: Hire

In this context, it is **acceptable to have a higher number of False Negatives (accepting False H0)** than False Positives (rejecting True H0). In simpler terms, it is preferable for the model to classify more candidates as "Do not Hire" (H0) than as "Hire" (H1). This approach is chosen because **hiring underperforming individuals can lead to more substantial costs**. Therefore, in this case, a higher False Negative Rate is considered more favorable than a higher False Positive Rate. Consequently, the chosen metric for the classification process is "**Precision.**"
